    - California’s central valley is responsible for producing 1/3 of the nation’s vegetables and nearly 2/3 of the nation’s fruits and nuts, namely 90% of the 
      nation’s strawberries.
      <br><br>
    - However, although over half a million farmworkers serve in this production process, they remain powerless and are exploited, paid unfair wages and provided 
      shabby accommodations due to their undocumented status.  
      <br><br>
    - Additionally, it is legal for children to work in the fields starting from when they are only 12 years old and thus farmworkers’ children are 
      forced to work several hours a day to help make ends meet.
      <br><br>
    - This valuable time that they spend in the fields is cut from their time to develop and grow as students and because of constantly bending down to pick 
      strawberries, the kids develop spinal cord and brain defects causing their IQs to go drastically down.  
      <br><br>
    - In addition, because these families are forced to live a migrant lifestyle, having to move when strawberry picking season is over and to come back when it is 
      time again, kids schooling is disrupted and thus even though many of these kids have the option to continue schooling, they continually fall behind, are not 
      motivated enough to stay in school and soon drop out to continue to help on the fields

 We have created this site as a way for specifically farmworker's kids in WatsonVille, CA to have access to not only a game that helps teach basic, but important math skills, but a way for them to have access to other resources such as the mentorship forum. These resources allows these kids to have direct access to people who can help answer their questions, gain connections in the real world, and give them advice for future endeavors. Additionally, our hopes are to help all those who are not able to continue their education due to extraneous circumstances. We hope to foster a learning environment that is fun and pushes creativity.
       <br><br>
Lastly, we would like to further incentivize this project with sponsorships/fundings for college and university in the future.
