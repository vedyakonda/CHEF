<div class = "fact1"> <center> <h1> - California’s central valley is responsible for producing 1/3 of the nation’s vegetables 
  and nearly 2/3 of the nation’s fruits and nuts, namely 90% of the nation’s strawberries. <br><br> </h1> </center> </div>
 
<div class = "fact2"> <center> <h1> - However, although over half a million farmworkers serve in this production process, they remain powerless and are exploited, paid unfair wages and provided 
  shabby accommodations due to their undocumented status. <br><br> </h1> </center></div>

<div class = "fact3"> <center> <h1> - Additionally, it is legal for children to work in the fields starting from when they are only 12 years old and thus farmworkers’ children are 
  forced to work several hours a day to help make ends meet. <br><br> </h1> </center> </div>

<div class = "fact4"> <center> <h1> - This valuable time that they spend in the fields is cut from their time to develop and grow as students and because of constantly bending down to pick 
  strawberries, the kids develop spinal cord and brain defects causing their IQs to go drastically down. <br><br> </h1> </center> </div>
  
<div class = "fact5"> <center> <h1> - In addition, because these families are forced to live a migrant lifestyle, having to move when strawberry picking season is over and to come back when it is 
      time again, kids schooling is disrupted and thus even though many of these kids have the option to continue schooling, they continually fall behind, are not 
  motivated enough to stay in school and soon drop out to continue to help on the fields. <br><br> </h1> </center> </div>
